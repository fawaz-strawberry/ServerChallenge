Project Ideas (Updated):
    
    ReactJS Server
        - Handle Front End UI
        - Add, Grab, Remove Object Configs from the Database
        - Websocket connection to Simulation server for Object Data
        - Send REST API calls to simulation server to tell object to move or modify data
    
    NodeJS(Express) Backend
        - Handles communications with mongoDB
        - Handles requests from the ReactJS Server for Config functions

    MongoDB
        - Holds Configurations for all the different types of objects
        - All objects have an ID, Title, Position, Orientation, and various others depending on type

    Simulation Server
        - NodeJS server which simulates multiple objects that u websocket into (note: multiple ports required)
        - REST API calls to modify object data such as location, rotation, and such
        - Cadence of 500ms per object


Note: Project Built on Windows Machine


<!-- Deprecated Project Ideas:

    Frontend Utilizing ReactJS for live updates on data
        - To get object data, websocket connection with NodeJS server to update current data displayed 
        - To add, remove, update a new object with new config utilize a REST POST Requst to Backend server
    
    Backend NodeJS with Express and MongoDB
        - MongoDB will hold a document for each "random object" and it's configuration
            -Configuration includes ID, title, location by default, dynamic adding of additional data
        
        - MongoDB will also contain one document with a list of all active objects and their configurations.
            - Generated by the configuration MongoDB

        - Websocket connection that will send back data for active objects.
            - Websocket function will call MongoDB to get active object data
        
        - Request functions to add, remove, and update configurations

    Python Simulation script that will randomly change and modify object attributes. -->


Future Improvements:

    - Notify values not within bounds
    - Move Objects on map by dragging them
    - Better Camera work and camera locking
    - Docker implementation
